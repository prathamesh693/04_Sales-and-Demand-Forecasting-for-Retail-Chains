## üõ†Ô∏è Project Lifecycle
1. Data Collection & Understanding
    - Dataset from Walmart's Kaggle competition including historical sales and store metadata.
2. Data Preprocessing
    - Merging datasets, handling missing values, creating new features (e.g. month, holiday flag).
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
    - Sales trends, outliers, seasonality patterns, and feature correlations.
4. Model Building
    - Train and test time series models:
        - ARIMA (Statistical)
        - Facebook Prophet (Additive Seasonality)
        - LSTM (Deep Learning)
5. Model Evaluation
    - Compare models using RMSE, MAE, and visual forecasts.
6. Model Deployment (Optional)
    - Streamlit dashboard to interactively visualize predictions by store and department.

## üíª Tools and Technologies
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- Statsmodels (ARIMA), Facebook Prophet, TensorFlow/Keras (LSTM)
- Jupyter Notebooks, Spyder, Streamlit
- Git for version control

## ‚úîÔ∏è Success Criteria
- Achieve high accuracy and low forecasting error.
- Robust models that generalize well.
- Clear, actionable insights via visualizations.
- Easy-to-use forecasting pipeline and dashboard.

## üìà Expected Outcome
- Reliable weekly sales forecasts by store.
- Visual reports highlighting trends and forecasts.
- Reusable code modules for future forecasting projects.
