## 📌 Problem Statement
Retail chains must anticipate customer demand accurately to avoid overstocking or understocking. This project uses historical sales, store information, and economic indicators to build forecasting models that can predict weekly sales across multiple retail stores.

## 🎯 Objective
- Predict weekly sales for retail stores accurately.
- Use statistical and deep learning time series models.
- Build an end-to-end pipeline from preprocessing to forecasting.
- Provide an interactive dashboard to visualize sales trends and forecasts.

## ⚠️ Challenges
- Handling seasonality, promotions, and holidays in sales data.
- Integrating multiple datasets (sales, store info, economic indicators).
- Comparing traditional and deep learning forecasting models.
- Ensuring model performance on unseen future data.
